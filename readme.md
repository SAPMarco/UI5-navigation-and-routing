# UI5-Navigation-and-Routing

This repository is meant to serve as example for how navigation and routing works within UI5. It is basically what happens when you work through the entire "Navigation and Routing"-Section within the official [UI5 documentation](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/1b6dcd39a6a74f528b27ddb22f15af0d).

### The complete flow of the application as it can also be seen on the [Documentation](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/1b6dcd39a6a74f528b27ddb22f15af0d).

You basically read it like this - starting from the home page (here simply called 'Home') you can do the following:

* Display a _Not Found_ page
* Navigate to a list of employees and drill further down to see a _Details_ page for each employee
* Show an _Employee Overview_ that they can search and sort
