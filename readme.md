# UI5-Navigation-and-Routing

This repository is meant to serve as example for how navigation and routing works within UI5. It is basically what happens when you work through the entire "Navigation and Routing"-Section within the official [UI5 documentation](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/1b6dcd39a6a74f528b27ddb22f15af0d).

### The complete flow of the application as it can also be seen on the [Documentation](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/1b6dcd39a6a74f528b27ddb22f15af0d).
